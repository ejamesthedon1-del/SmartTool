# GitHub Repository Cleanup Summary

## Actions Performed

### 1. Restored Working Version
- **Main Branch**: Reset to commit 219c292 (last known working version after dashboard update)
- **Theme-update Branch**: Also reset to the same commit for consistency
- Both branches now contain the clean, working version with:
  - Modern dashboard layout
  - Functional AI analysis
  - No broken Stripe integration

### 2. Deleted Extra Branches
The following branches were deleted from GitHub:
- `backup-current-state` - Temporary backup branch
- `restore-working-dashboard` - Temporary restoration branch

### 3. Current Repository State
The repository now has only the necessary branches:
- `main` - Primary branch with working version
- `theme-update` - Development branch (mirrors main)

## What's in the Working Version
- ✅ Modern dashboard with enhanced design
- ✅ All AI analysis functionality (Gemini integration)
- ✅ Charts and data visualizations
- ✅ Navigation between pages
- ✅ Basic payment form (without Stripe)
- ✅ Clean build without errors

## Next Steps
